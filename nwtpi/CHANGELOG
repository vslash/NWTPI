2013/04/22	R44			introducing OEGLSurface <=> NativeElement (windowSurface) 
2013/04/15	R38			complete new design including classes rewriting : 
						> NWTPI::NativeWindow + NativeElement + NativeResource
						> NWTPI::OEGLWindow + OEGLCapabilities
						Naming conv. : OEGL instead of EGL in order to avoid type mismatch with EGL.
						Maintain testtriangle.cpp example as simple as expected with very small change.
